# Database
This a set of files for a website that I implemented for a school project. It is a ordering system to which you can buy books from. 

I have seperate sql files that create the database and other files that manipulate the database based on user input.

The php code was triggered through seperate html files that I have not included in this repository as it is large enough as is. The names of the files illustrate what the php code was suppose to do.
